# p5 template project

Forked from [https://github.com/Gaweph/p5-typescript-starter](https://github.com/Gaweph/p5-typescript-starter)

## Getting Started

You will need to have Node installed ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/))  
Download this repository and open it in your favorite IDE (I would **highly** recommend VS Code ([https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)))  
Then open a terminal at the root of the folder (you can do it in VS Code by simply dragging up the bottom of the window) and type the following commands :

### Installing

```
npm i -g npm-run-all typescript browser-sync
```

Only use this command the first time you ever use this template (-g means you install things globally)

### Launching

```
npm start
```

A local version will now be running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
You can now write all the p5 things you want in __*src/sketch.ts*__

### Publishing online

#### Using GitHub Pages

Create a GitHub repository and commit all your files (if that's not already done)

Then in the **Settings** of your repository, under **GitHub Pages** set Source to *main* and click Save.  
If you scroll back down to **GitHub Pages** you can now see the url of your sketch ! (it might take a few minutes to be published online)
